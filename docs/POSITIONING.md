# Unbrowse — Positioning Brief
## "Google for OpenClaw"

---

## One-Liner

**Unbrowse is Google for OpenClaw.**

Google indexes information. Unbrowse indexes actions.

---

## The Insight

Every website has a hidden API — the internal endpoints that power their frontend. When you click "Add to Cart," your browser sends an API call. We capture that.

One OpenClaw agent learns a site → skill gets indexed → every OpenClaw agent can use it.

**One agent learns. All agents know.**

---

## Why OpenClaw Only

Unbrowse learns skills through OpenClaw's browser automation layer. This isn't a limitation — it's the architecture.

| Function | Platform |
|----------|----------|
| Learning skills | OpenClaw only |
| Using skills | Any agent (HTTP calls) |
| Sharing skills | Marketplace (USDC) |

This tight coupling means:
- Unbrowse rises with OpenClaw adoption
- Network effects compound within one ecosystem
- No fragmentation across platforms

---

## The Analogy

```
Chrome : Google :: OpenClaw : Unbrowse
```

- Chrome is how humans browse the web
- Google is how humans search for information
- OpenClaw is how agents browse the web
- **Unbrowse is how agents search for actions**

---

## Core Value Props

### 1. Collective Action Memory
What one agent learns, all agents know. Skills compound.

### 2. Speed
GUI automation: 10+ seconds per action
Unbrowse: 50ms per action (200x faster)

### 3. Reliability
No more broken selectors. API-level stability.

### 4. Auth Solved Once
Login flows, tokens, sessions — captured once, auto-refreshed forever.

---

## The Network Effect

```
More OpenClaw users
      ↓
More skills learned
      ↓
More valuable for everyone
      ↓
More OpenClaw users
```

This is why platform lock-in is a feature, not a bug.

## Competitive Position

| | Browser-Use | Zapier | Unbrowse |
|---|-------------|--------|----------|
| Learning | Individual | None | Collective |
| Speed | Slow (GUI) | Fast | Fast |
| Coverage | Any site | Integrations only | Any site |
| Sharing | None | None | Marketplace |
| Platform | Any | Any | OpenClaw |

**Unbrowse = Browser-Use's collective memory layer**

---

## Revenue Model

```
Creator:  70%  — Instant USDC payout
Platform: 30%  — Infrastructure
```

Pay per skill purchase. Skills are owned forever.

## What NOT to Say

❌ "Works with any agent framework" — it doesn't
❌ "Scraping" / "Hacking" — legal concerns
❌ "Faster" as the lead — table stakes
❌ Generic "AI agent tool" — too vague

## What TO Say

✅ "Google for OpenClaw" — the positioning
✅ "Skills" not "APIs" — consumer-friendly
✅ "Learn" / "Teach" — action-oriented
✅ "Collective" / "Compound" — network effects
✅ "Earn USDC" — creator incentive

---

## The Bet

Unbrowse bets that OpenClaw wins the agent runtime race.

If OpenClaw becomes the default way agents interact with the world, Unbrowse becomes essential infrastructure — the index of everything agents know how to do.

That's the bet.
