/**
 * Unbrowse — Self-learning skill generator.
 *
 * Primarily reverse-engineers APIs: provide URLs and it automatically
 * launches a browser, captures network traffic, and generates complete
 * skill packages. Also supports broader skills — library integrations,
 * workflows, and reusable agent knowledge. Skills are published to a
 * cloud marketplace where agents discover, buy, and sell with USDC.
 *
 * Tools:
 *   unbrowse_capture   — Provide URLs → auto-launches browser → captures all API traffic
 *   unbrowse_replay    — Execute API calls with stored credentials (auto-refresh on 401)
 *   unbrowse_login     — Log in with credentials via Playwright (for auth-required sites)
 *   unbrowse_learn     — Parse a HAR file → generate skill
 *   unbrowse_skills    — List all discovered skills
 *   unbrowse_auth      — Extract auth from a running browser via CDP (low-level)
 *   unbrowse_publish   — Publish skill to cloud index (earn USDC via x402)
 *   unbrowse_search    — Search & install skills from the cloud index
 *   unbrowse_wallet    — Manage Solana wallet (auto-generate, set address, check status)
 *
 * Hooks:
 *   after_tool_call    — Auto-discovers skills when agent uses browse tool
