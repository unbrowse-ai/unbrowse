Our Hong Kong brokerage clients are all Class B and C exchange participants. Our integrated securities trading platform services mainly include front desk trading system services, market data services and value-added services. With proprietary software that we have independently developed, improved, and enhanced over the years, we believe that we are an early adopter of an integrated model that provides Hong Kong securities companies with front-end transaction system services and market data services. Among Hong Kong brokers, we have a huge market share among domestic securities brokers in Hong Kong. Our main services are divided into three categories:  (i) front desk trading system services; (ii) market data services; and (iii) value-added services (such as simulated trading platform services, online booking opening services, and cloud infrastructure services). Our services are mainly delivered through the securities trading platform software we have developed, which is the customer software and delivery channels that we mainly serve, such as the TradeGo public version.</p></p>Our customers and end-users can access our developed securities trading platform software through multiple channels including major operating systems (including Microsoft Windows, MacOS, Android, and iOS) and mainstream platforms (such as web browsers). As of June 30, 2017, we provided integrated securities market trading platform and system solutions to 61 Hong Kong securities companies. Regarding the coverage of the securities trading platform software for the supportable operating systems and platforms, based on the revenue for the year ending March 31, 2017, we served five major non-transnational companies in Hong Kong. Among the suppliers are market leaders. Our front desk trading system services can support the trading of various financial instruments, including stocks, exchange-traded funds, futures, options, warrants and derivatives. We also hold market data vendor licenses for five stock and futures exchanges (ie Hong Kong Stock Exchange, Hong Kong Futures Exchange, Shanghai Stock Exchange, Shenzhen Stock Exchange, and Cboe) and through our developed securities transactions. The platform software provides various real-time market data pushes for these exchanges.</p></p>Our mission is to provide support to investors and financial intermediaries through the provision of best tools and platforms so that they can use all mainstream channels to access real-time market data and trade anywhere in the world. Since its establishment in 2010, we have always been committed to developing and providing integrated securities trading platform and market data services.</p>",
