## Project

Unbrowse — reverse-engineer any website into reusable API skills. Monorepo with bun workspaces.

## Structure

- `src/` — shared skill engine (capture, reverse-engineer, execute)
- `backend/` — Cloudflare Worker API (marketplace, stats)
- `frontend/` — Next.js landing page
- `packages/skill/` — isolated publishable skill package (src/ symlinks to root)

## Conventions

- All notable changes must be written into `CHANGELOG.md`
- Use `bash scripts/sync-skill.sh` to publish skill changes to `unbrowse-ai/unbrowse`

## GitHub

- Only create PRs and issues — do not push directly to main
