# CLAUDE.md

## Project

Unbrowse — reverse-engineer any website into reusable API skills. Monorepo with bun workspaces.

## Structure

- `src/` — shared skill engine (capture, reverse-engineer, execute)
- `backend/` — Cloudflare Worker API (marketplace, stats)
- `frontend/` — Next.js landing page
- `packages/skill/` — isolated publishable skill package (src/ symlinks to root)

## Conventions

- All notable changes must be written into `CHANGELOG.md`
- Use conventional commit prefixes: `feat:`, `fix:`, `perf:`, `refactor:`, `chore:`
- Use `bash scripts/sync-skill.sh` to publish skill changes to `unbrowse-ai/unbrowse`

## Releases

When asked to release, follow this flow:

1. Read commits since last tag: `git log $(git describe --tags --match='v*' --abbrev=0)..HEAD --format="%s"`
2. Read the diff of user-facing code (src/, packages/, SKILL.md, README.md)
3. Write polished, user-facing release notes to `.release-notes.md` (see format below)
4. Run `bun run release` — bumps version, updates CHANGELOG, tags, creates GitHub Release using the notes
5. The tag push triggers CI which deploys backend + frontend and syncs + releases the skill repo

### Release notes format (.release-notes.md)

Write for developers and AI agent builders. Focus on what users can do now, not implementation details. Skip internal/backend-only changes. Use this structure:

```
## What's New
(1-2 sentences per feature)

## Fixes
(1 line per fix)

## Performance
(1 line with before/after numbers if available)
```

Omit empty sections. No emojis. No file paths or function names.

### Config

- `release-it` with `@release-it/conventional-changelog` (config: `.release-it.json`)
- Versions synced across: `package.json`, `packages/skill/package.json`, `version.json`
- Do not bump versions or create tags manually — `release-it` handles it

## GitHub

- Only create PRs and issues — do not push directly to main
- Secrets needed for releases: `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`, `SKILL_REPO_TOKEN`
